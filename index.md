# Johnny Depp

This is a tribute to my wife's favourite movie character. She loves his expressive eyes, his long hair and how he acts in his movies especially in "The pirates of the carribean".
My first movie with Johnny Depp that i saw was "Edward mit den Scherenhaenden". It was very funny seeing him cutting all the plants and flowers in his castle garden in that movie.
